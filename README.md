# Connext-IIITD
Connext-IIITD is a prototype which aims to provide seamless solutions for managing events in the college campus. It helps the users to schedule an event, declare results and help each other interact during that event. The project is done as a part of Human Computer Interaction course at IIIT-Delhi under Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah

## Abstract
After receiving multiple emails of events happening in college and not having any platform that
organises everything we decided to make a platform of our own to help all the students in college
regarding the same. Initially, we had thought of creating a simple event booking application like
BookMyShow but later changed it to have more social elements to it which will be described in
detail later. One of the biggest challenges that we faced while we were making this is trying to
give an immersive experience. We wanted the user to feel the registration part of our application
is integrated within the social media aspects and to ensure this we had to go through multiple
iterations of the same and finally we were content with our final design

## Introduction
Just after a few months of being in college, even with the current semester being an online one,
the number of emails we received for various events happening in college became quite
overwhelming and we only knew that it would get worse once college opens physically. From the
get-go, we knew that we wanted to solve this problem. We wanted to organise and put everything
related to campus events and various club activities in one place, be it getting to know about an
event to registering for the event, everything in one place.
The problem with emails being the only source of communication for clubs and event organisers
with students is that it clutters your inbox, making it hard to differentiate between your
course-related emails and extracurricular-related emails. This makes discovering new events very
difficult as going through so many emails is a very tedious process.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197781597-f1462671-8918-4df7-b136-abb1f64471e5.png)  

One look at this screenshot proves that it is a problem. Also, we can see that you receive emails
for all events even if you are not interested in them. Let’s you don’t like to dance, why would you
want updates from the dance society? Thus giving the user the ability to filter the content to their
own liking becomes a necessity. And finally, we wanted to give the user a seamless experience
between going through the feed of multiple events to registering for them cause let’s be honest,
no one likes to fill multiple forms.
After a long week of grinding deadline after deadline, all of us at college look for something fun
happening to unwind and thus we think the whole student body and even the professors if they
wish to join would be the target user base.
Yes, apart from emails there are other alternatives to the above-mentioned problems like social
networking sites like Instagram but there are a lot of the same as well as a new set of different
problems. Firstly the cluttering of inbox here becomes cluttering of your feed and secondly, not
everyone is and wants to be on platforms like Instagram. This makes Connext ideal for them as
they get an exclusive platform for their college events and they need not rely on other
applications for the same.
The final iteration of connext lets different clubs make their own pages and post about events that
they are organising, the user can simply click on such a post to go to the registration page of the
same event. Further, The user can post on the pages of different Clubs, somewhat like Reddit and
how it works with the whole subreddit system and if the user ever thinks that they want to say
something to the organiser privately they can always direct message whatever they’d like to say
directly to the club’s page which will be handled by the coordinators of the club.

## Methodology
As clearly mentioned in the introduction, the problem to solve at hand was to give students and
clubs a better alternative to email for communication and also a better platform to register for
events. The target user base then would obviously be all the students. The stakeholders would be
the different clubs as they would gain traction because of this platform.

### Initial Ideation

As soon as we realised the problem at hand, we knew what we had to do. We knew that we
needed to design a very good event management app that eliminated the need for emails, that
ensured better communication and we needed to give a seamless experience between discovering

### Gathering Feedback
From the initial feedback, all we wanted is to check the relevance of our idea. Is the problem that
we think is a problem or are we just tunnel-visioned. We also wanted to check which approach to
take. Would they like social elements in it or would they prefer a platform like BookMyShow
that is solely built to register for various events?
We rolled out an initial questionnaire to ask these questions to the students in college and the
results were quite positive. Another important thing to note would be that this form was rolled
out during Cadence which was probably the week with the maximum number of college
activities of the year.

After we gathered our initial 50 responses, we were quite pleased to know that our idea has
relevance and is not something we made up just for the sake of it and it was also made very clear
to us that the end-users would prefer an application with social elements.

### Developing the LoFi Prototype
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197782377-4d7341b5-c0f0-4088-bb07-06cf24edd207.png)  
For our LoFi prototype, we wanted to make the first design of the profile page for any User or
Club and also wanted to make a page for registering for an event as these two pages are arguably
the most important. One thing that was clear to us from the get-go is that even though we wanted
a seamless experience between club pages and the event pages we wanted to make the events
pages have a different feel and not just look like a profile page button with a register button at the
bottom, this carried over to the HiFi Prototype as well. Things like the Post/Event toggle also
carried over to our final prototype. It is used to either toggle between posts a user makes and
their registered events or between the posts a club is making and its members. The Navigation
bar also remained as it is in the final prototype with it having a home button that takes you to the
home screen which is supposed to have all posts being made by and to different clubs, the search
button which lets you search through the entire app for different profiles and clubs, the calendar
button that opens a planner of all the events you are registered in and finally the rightmost button
which takes you back to your profile. All of these except the calendar button were too trivial to
not add, however, giving easy access to a calendar/planner seemed like a good idea for an event
management application.

### Iterating the Lo-FI
The home page in our LoFi Prototype had all posts made by all users to everyone to all pages
filtered by the time of posting, the first change we wanted to make is to give the users the ability
to filter the home screen content by their liking. Filter by All, which gives the rising post made
by people on all clubs’ pages, Following, giving the posts made on the page of all the clubs you
are following filtered by time and the recent, which only filters by time.
Further, we realised that having a direct message option is very important to give users the option
to ask questions from club coordinators in privacy. In the next iterations, we made message
buttons on the home and profile page screen that takes you to your inbox and the message icon
on club pages takes you directly to their direct message.

### Developing the Hi-Fi Prototype
The first thing we had to decide was the platform on which we were to create the prototype and
for that, we chose Figma because it is firstly free to use and secondly very beginner-friendly.
After iterating through the LoFi prototype multiple times designing the HiFi became quite easy
actually, all we had to do was to make sure we used the appropriate design principles while
designing the HiFi while following the core structure of the LoFi.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197782739-87163481-5519-480f-9acb-b82abdc3c73c.png)  
This includes various things from using appropriate and familiar buttons so that the user is
already familiar with the UI the first time they log in, to making sure text is visible. From making
sure the animations fit with the transitions to making sure the buttons are easily identifiable by
the user and not just a flat shape with text on it.

### The Hi-Fi Prototype
The first few iterations of the HiFi prototype were to create the core structure of the different
pages, choosing the colour schemes, roughly identifying the position of different containers and
mind mapping the wireframing which we might use for the app.
Then for the next few iterations, we were focused on making sure the icons, buttons and
containers fit perfectly, and also on figuring out the different interactions we would offer in the
App like overlays and contextual menus showing up, vertical and horizontal for different pages
and also the transitions between different pages.
Final iterations before taking feedback were mostly about making sure the UI looks aesthetically
pleasing which included a lot of colour correction and minute details like the highlight we added
on the navigation bar icons when you’re on its respective page.
In the end, we almost forgot to add the most important feature that any app could have but
remembered at the last moment before releasing the prototype for feedback. We finally added a
dark mode cause let’s be honest, as computer science students we cannot look at a light interface
for more than 10 seconds anymore.
The core of the prototype is the feed, the profile page of the user or club and the screen to
register for an event. Further screens of search, calendar, internal applications settings have also
been added.

### Hi-Fi Prototype Feedback
From this set of Feedback questions, our main objective was to gain some insight into the user’s
perspective about our design, functionality, ease of use and getting to know of the bugs which we
might have missed.
From the first 35 responses that we had gotten, the response was quite positive. The consensus of
the feedback was that the users were easily able to navigate through the UI, found the design
aesthetically pleasing, and could see our prototype turn into a legitimate and functional
application.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197783238-c1bd7316-1368-4ff7-abf1-4d96a3b241ca.png)  

Amidst all the positive feedback, came a glaring issue that we overlooked. The wireframing had
multiple bugs which took us to pages we did not intend to go to and also another issue was that
only the text portions of buttons were clickable and not the entire button.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197783333-901ef882-5666-4df5-9f85-a8e2ee24a6f8.png)  

### Evaluation and Final Iterations
After reviewing the responses from the previous feedback form, our first job was to fix
wireframing and button issue, after that we had realised that we did not have a “Follow” button
for clubs, so we even had to add that bringing us to the current state of the prototype which
hopefully does not have major bugs. After which we sent the final prototypes to a select few
users to gather their opinion.
For the evaluation process, we cannot be more thankful to Abhik S. Basu and Aadit Kant Jha
who are both students at IIIT Delhi and were with us at every step of the way.
The evaluation criteria were
● Appropriate use of Icons  
● Aesthetics and Colour Scheme  
● Functional Wireframing  
● Visibility, readability and Clarity  
Both of them thought that the Icons we had used did fit the design and even the Wireframing was
fine after we had fixed the issues we were having with Buttons and the dysfunctional
wireframing. However, regarding Aesthetics and Colour scheme we got very valuable feedback
that changing the highlight colour of the navigation bar from a shade of red to a shade of green
would look much better.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76804249/197783506-c21a81c2-a37a-45f0-b927-d923b3799927.png)  
After testing out the suggestion we decided to go ahead with it as it made the highlight look like
it belongs there rather than just sticking out like a sore thumb. Another critical thing pointed out
to us by Abhik was the home feed felt too congested and that messed with the clarity, we fixed
this immediately by increasing the space between the containers and then adding fine separating
lines between the containers and this greatly improved the overall visibility of the Home Feed.
We continued the process till the time we as well as both of them were happy with the final
iteration and this brings us to the current prototype that we have.
### Analysis and Future Work
After going through about 1-2 phases of Ideation, 1-2 phases of LoFi, and 7-8 phases of HiFi we
realised that good design takes a lot of time to implement, it’s not something that can be
implemented in one go, it takes multiple iterations, making minute changes every time and for
that constant feedback is a necessity. A developer giving a solution to a problem that is not even
considered as a problem by the users is then not a solution, it is just a redundant piece of
software. In our case, the first and probably the most valuable feedback was us getting to know
that the problem we are proposing a solution to is actually a problem that a lot of people have
faced and without this validation there would have been no point in going further. Another
reason why constant feedback is necessary is that as developers we tend to ignore the flaws of
our design and no matter how hard we look at it we’ll never be able to figure out flaws with our
own design because of emotional attachment to our work, however, the end-user will always be
objective. From all the feedback we also realised that even though people like aesthetics, they
almost always prefer a simplistic design with minimum clutter, we ourselves had to go through
almost 3-4 iterations to fix the clutter.
Apart from design the users also want good functionality out of your app. A beautifully designed
piece of software will never compensate for the lack of functionality and sometimes there can
also be too much functionality and you need to restrict the openness of your platform for a better
experience of your platform. We could have very easily given the users the ability to make open
posts but that would change the whole point of the application and thus restricting the user and in
quantitative terms reduce the functionality here was a better design choice.
The drawbacks of our proposed solution are the same as any other computer/mobile based
solution to any other problem. It is that it requires a certain amount of privilege to have access to
smartphones and a good internet connection, however, this becomes less and less of an issue as
time passes as the prices of phones have only gone down and Mobile data in India is one of the
cheapest it is out there in the entire world.
The Future of Connext can be very huge. Campus events are not a thing that happen only in IIIT
Delhi, every college in the world could probably use a better event management app. To scale
this beyond IIIT Delhi and make this financially viable product by adopting the financial
strategies of various social networking websites would be our first goal.
### Conclusion
After a tiring week at college, all of us deserve something chill to unwind to and just have fun
and what better way to do so than take part in events happening in your own college with your
own friends. Connext is the one-stop solution for managing their college life and participating in
college events. Our application can notify users regarding the scheduled time of events and
ensures no one misses any event they really wanted to attend.
It makes the registration process seamless and helps to interact with our teammates during an
event thus enriching team skills. Users can easily give their feedback regarding the recent events
and suggest which new event and artist they would like to have on the campus.
We would like to implement the service in college and will improve it based on the real-time
feedback of our users. As time goes and when our service needs more capital to grow, we have
proposed a revenue model in which the respective clubs would fund our service and we can also
charge a very nominal commission from small artists whom we are giving a platform to
showcase their talent.
It is indeed not incorrect to say that Connext IIITD is Campus Events Simplified.
